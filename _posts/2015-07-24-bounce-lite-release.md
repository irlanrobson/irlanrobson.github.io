I'm happy for distributing Bounce Lite, a portable 3D physics engine for games:

[https://github.com/irlanrobson/Bounce-Lite](https://github.com/irlanrobson/Bounce-Lite)

Bounce Lite is available on its GitHub repository. It is the second physics engine that I (Irlan) have written and the first one that has been publically distributed.

Some of the physics engine features can be seen in the basic (.pdf) documentation living inside the repository. Additionaly, a demo application lives inside the repository.

As many other engines, Bounce Lite is inspired by Erin Catto's Box2D.
