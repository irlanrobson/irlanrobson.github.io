Here's a list of personal projects Irlan has been working on in his free time over the recent years.

[**Bounce**](https://github.com/irlanrobson/bounce) - An open-source 3D physics engine for games. Check out the repository for seeing the feature list.

[**Bounce Lite**](https://github.com/irlanrobson/bounce_lite) - Bounce Lite is a lightweight version of Bounce. This library is particularly useful for people who are interested in learning the foundations of 3D game physics engines.

[**Animation**](https://github.com/irlanrobson/animation) - This repository was created in order for the author to learn animation systems. It contains some code implementing skeletal animation and skinning. Animations are read from simple .fbx files.
